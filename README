sessionchooser - a text-based session chooser
(c) 2010-2011 by Tilman Blumenbach <tilman@ax86.net>

sessionchooser is a simple (and admittedly not very user-friendly,
whatever that means), text-based session chooser. It reads Desktop Entry
files as defined by the Desktop Entry Specification, version 1.0 [1] but
also supports so-called "text sessions" -- while sessions defined in Desktop
Entry files are sessions depending on a X server, text sessions are simply
(but not necessarily simple) shell scripts which can contain pretty much
everything, even Python scripts (provided you didn't forget the shebang).
You may also return to the current shell by entering "0" at the
sessionchooser prompt. The session you chose will be remembered for the
next run and becomes the default choice (just press enter).

By default, X sessions are searched in /etc/X11/sessions/, and text sessions
are searched in /etc/sessionchooser/textsessions/. You may change these
defaults at compile time (in defines.h) or override them on runtime by
setting the environment variables SESSIONCHOOSER_XPATH and
SESSIONCHOOSER_TEXTPATH. They both follow standard PATH syntax, i. e.
you may specify a list of directories to search by separating them with
colons. Empty paths are interpreted as the current working directory.

sessionchooser is intended to be run right after login. To do that, you
simply have to "source" the helper script (called "helper.sh" in this
distribution; install it somewhere on your system -- you can rename it
if you want), for example from your ~/.bash_login (for bash) or
~/.zprofile (for zsh).

X sessions will use the next free X display and sessionchooser will try
start the X server on the current VT for your convenience. You may specify
additional arguments for the X server by setting the environment variable
SESSIONCHOOSER_XARGS (it may be a good idea to set it to "-nolisten tcp -br",
for example).
