Version 2.2         2016-09-25 Tilman Blumenbach
    - Normalize paths using NFC and not NFD, as recommended
      here: https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/uc/nfc_vs_nfd.html
    - Remove SESS_GETTEXT_DIR macro as Gettext uses the correct
      directory by default.

Version 2.1         2014-09-20 Tilman Blumenbach
    - Session prompt: If the pre-selected choice is a
      text session, prepend "Text: " to the session name
      so that it does not look like an X session.
    - By default, in the generated command, do not discard
      stderr. This behaviour can be changed with the -S option.
      This change ensures that sessionchooser works with rootless
      X11 out-of-the-box.
    - The Arch Linux PKGBUILD can now be found at:
      https://github.com/Tblue/archlinux-packages

Version 2.0         2013-07-30 Tilman Blumenbach
    - Remember the last used session by its path. In
      contrast to the previously used session name, the
      path is unique and does not depend on the
      current locale.
    - Change versioning scheme to only a major and
      minor version. It's easier that way.

Version 1.2.5       2012-04-04 Tilman Blumenbach
    - Handle value of Exec key not being found in $PATH correctly
      (emit warning and keep going).

Version 1.2.4       2012-03-12 Tilman Blumenbach
    - Normalize session names with NFD instead of NFKD (no
      compatibility decomposition anymore).

Version 1.2.3       2011-12-26 Tilman Blumenbach
    - The default SESS_DEFAULT_XSESSION_SEARCH_PATH now contains
      /usr/share/xsessions as well.
    - Look up bare Exec commands in $PATH (i. e. commands that are
      not a path).

Version 1.2.2       2011-10-24 Tilman Blumenbach
    Some minor changes, most notably:
    - helper.sh: Unset possibly exported variable names before exec.
    - Tiny translation fix.

Version 1.2.1       2011-01-21 Tilman Blumenbach
    - Minor code optimizations
    - Only write lastsession file if necessary (session has changed).

Version 1.2.0       2011-01-19 Tilman Blumenbach
    - Feature: Suppress remembering of chosen session by appending '!' to the
               session number at the prompt.

Version 1.1.1       2010-10-28 Tilman Blumenbach
    - Optimization: Do not call terminfo_init() when clearing the screen has
                    not been requested.

Version 1.1         2010-10-28 Tilman Blumenbach
