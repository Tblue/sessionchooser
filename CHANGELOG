Version 2.0         2013-07-30 Tilman Blumenbach
    - Remember the last used session by its path. In
      contrast to the previously used session name, the
      path is unique and does not depend on the
      current locale.
    - Change versioning scheme to only a major and
      minor version. It's easier that way.

Version 1.2.5       2012-04-04 Tilman Blumenbach

      (emit warning and keep going).

Version 1.2.4       2012-03-12 Tilman Blumenbach
    - Normalize session names with NFD instead of NFKD (no
      compatibility decomposition anymore).

    - The default SESS_DEFAULT_XSESSION_SEARCH_PATH now contains
      /usr/share/xsessions as well.
    - Look up bare Exec commands in $PATH (i. e. commands that are
      not a path).
